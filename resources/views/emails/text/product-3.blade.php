Thanks for purchasing the Confident Laravel {{ $product->name }} package. You're going to be a "Git Master" in no time!

You can watch and download all 50 of the Confident Laravel course videos from the Dashboard - {{ route('dashboard.index') }}.

The next Q&A call will be Wednesday, March 20 at 12:00pm Eastern Time. Don't worry if you can't make the time. Each one will be recorded and available for playback from the Dashboard. So start preparing your questions and send them to me in advance if you can't make it.

The PDF, ePub, and mobi versions of the Confident Laravel ebook will be available soon. For now, you can view the HTML version from the Dasboard.

Be sure to follow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/gonedark - for even more content. And never hesitate to send me any questions or feedback.
